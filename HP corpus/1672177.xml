	<sentence id="1672177.s2" text="Prader-Willi can arise by inheritance of two chromosomes 15 from the mother and none from the father (uniparental maternal disomy)."/>

	<sentence id="1672177.s4" text="The phenotypic effects of maternal and paternal disomy of chromosome 15 are very different and inheritance of two normal 15s from one parent does not lead to normal development--strong evidence in man for genomic imprinting, in which the same gene has different effects dependent upon its parental origin."/>
